       The city was founded on October 14, 1889, by Jesús María Ocampo, also known as "Tigrero" (translates to "tiger killer") due to his love of hunting

To encourage settlement, Ocampo returned to Anaime to ask for the help of his friend Juan de la Cruz Cardona and to marry thirteen-year-old Arsenia Cardona. Six months after its founding, in August 1890, Armenia had reached a population of 100 people, allowing it to gain legal recognition by the government. The city was initially called Villa Holguín, in honor of

       Armenia is often referred to as "Ciudad Milagro" (Miracle City) due to its fast urban growth and development. For many residents, the name "Miracle City" resulted from the rapid rebuilding of the city following the 1999 earthquake. The city center has dozens of new buildings with better architectural standards to prevent the type of damage and loss of life that occurred during the 1999 earthquake. The city center includes a nine block pedestrian walkway, lined by shops and restaurants, through the center of the city and connecting two of the city's plazas. The local economy main trade is still based on the production of
