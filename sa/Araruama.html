      </h2>
      <p>
       The municipality of Araruama was occupied intensively by Indians Tupinambás, gardeners and potters populations of Amazonian origin, striking presence that left their villages since precolonial times. Urns, painted bowls, plus a wide variety of utilitarian ceramic forms are examples of what can be found in different archaeological sites in the region. The villages have researched, Morro Grande, in particular, dated 2200 years, are among the oldest occupations in this group Tupi in Brazil.
      </p>
      <p>
       The site that currently corresponds to the municipality of Araruama integrated the captaincy of São Vicente, donated to Martim Afonso de Sousa, still in colonial Brazil (1534), but the first news about the occupation of the territory were given in 1575 by the expedition of the governor of captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, Antonio Salema, who went to Cabo Frio and that decimated hundreds of French and Indians.
      </p>
      <p>
       The records on the territory of Araruama dating from 1615, as a result of the foundation of the present city of Cabo Frio, which came to promote recognition of the St. John River and Lagoon Araruama.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1626, the land encompassed by the Araruama sesmarias donated to Manuel Riscado which implemented a sawmill using Brazil wood and other hardwoods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through the edict of January 10, 1799, created the parish of San Sebastian Araruama, which belonged to the municipality of Cabo Frio until 1852, when, by Provincial Law No. 628, became part of the municipality of Saquarema.
      </p>
      <p>
       On February 6, 1859, the parish of San Sebastian Araruama was elevated to a town of Araruama due to the extinction of the Village of Saquarema. The elevation of Araruama to city occurred in January 22, 1890 by decree of Governor Francis Portela.

It was inaugurated by President Getúlio Vargas as hotel and casino in 1943, and worked well until 1946, when the game was banned in Brazil. We remained until the end of the 1990s, leaving few years left to turn into Faetec.
