       Belém is also known as the

       or the

       (City of
       <a href="/wiki/Mango" title="Mango">

       <i>
        Belém

       , a reference to an earlier name for the city, Santa Maria de Belém do Grão Pará, and also to differentiate it from Belém (Bethlehem) in Palestine.

      </p>
      <p>
       On January 12, 1616, he anchored in what is now known as Guajará Bay, formed by the confluence of the Para and

        Guama
       </a>
       Rivers, called by the Tupinambás, "Guaçu Paraná". Caldeira mistook the bay for the main channel, and thirty leagues (178 km) upstream, he built a wooden fort, covered with straw, which he called "Presépio" (nativity scene), now known as"Forte do Castelo". The colony formed by the fort was given the name Feliz Lusitânia, "Happy Lusitania". It was the embryo of the future city of Belém. The fort failed to suppress Dutch and French trading, but did ward off colonization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feliz Lusitânia was later called Nossa Senhora de Belém do Grão Pará (Our Lady of Bethlehem of Grao-Para) and Santa Maria de Belém (St. Mary of Bethlehem). Belém was given city status in 1655 and was made capital of the State when Pará state was split off from

       On the second Sunday in October, Pará celebrates the largest religious event in Brazil: the
       <a href="/wiki/Procession" title="Procession">
        procession
       </a>
       of the Círio of Nazaré. This tradition started when a farmer and lumberman called Plácido José de Souza found an image of the Virgin and Child on the edge of the Murucutu creek, where the
       <a href="/wiki/Basilica_of_Our_Lady_of_Nazareth_of_Exile" title="Basilica of Our Lady of Nazareth of Exile">
        Basilica of Our Lady of Nazareth of Exile
       </a>
       stands today. He decided to take the image home. However, the image would mysteriously go back to the place where it was initially found every time he took it home. So Plácido decided to build a small
       <a href="/wiki/Chapel" title="Chapel">
        chapel
       </a>
       on the edge of the creek. This episode was regarded as miraculous throughout the region. It attracted hundreds of believers to see the image and pay homage to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then, the Círio has been celebrated as a long procession lasting around five hours, in which thousands of people follow the statue through the streets of Belém. The Círio festival is regarded as the "Christmas of the Amazon" because everyone is involved in the arrangements to receive the saint. In early September, minor celebrations take place as a spiritual preparation for the Círio, with thousands of images scattered all over the capital and neighboring cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       In time it became necessary to incorporate new elements into the tradition due to the people's desire to honor their patron saint. On the Saturday morning prior to the Círio procession the statue is taken to the square of
       <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ananindeua" title="Ananindeua">
        Ananindeua

       , a nearby city, to begin a Road Pilgrimage to the Icoaraci pier for a
       <a href="/wiki/Mass_in_the_Catholic_Church" title="Mass in the Catholic Church">
        Mass
       </a>
       . The river pilgrimage then begins. It was created to honor the "water men" who regard the Virgin of Nazareth as their patron saint. There is a traditional ship contest to award the most originally decorated boat. When the Sacred Image leaves Icoaraci in a Navy
       <a href="/wiki/Corvette" title="Corvette">
        Corvette
       </a>
       , it is followed by dozens of boats and ships through the waters of Guajará Bay to the pier of Belém, from where it is escorted all the way to the Gentil Bittencourt School. The subsequent candle-lit procession symbolizes the story of the discovery of the Saint and its return to where it was found. The procession follows the Carriage, to which a huge rope is tied, which is carried by the faithful until the procession arrives at the Sé Cathedral.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the procession, there is a

       <a href="/wiki/Cathedral" title="Cathedral">
        Cathedral
       </a>
       . At daybreak of the next day, the faithful start to gather at the Old City, believing that this will bring them closer to the Virgin. At 7 o'clock, the
       <a href="/wiki/Archbishop" title="Archbishop">
        archbishop
       </a>
       conducts the image to the carriage as bells toll and fireworks explode. The main procession then goes through the streets of the city to the Architectonic Centre of Nazareth, known for its Sanctuary Square. As it arrives at the square, the image is removed from the carriage for the celebration of a Mass and then lifted so that everybody will be blessed by the patron saint of Pará.
      </p>
      <p>
       The festivities last 15 days, with religious celebrations, like the Children's Círio, and its procession, held two Sundays after the Círio. The Re-Círio marks the end of the celebrations, with a shorter course back to the Gentil Bittencourt chapel.

       Hangar, whose auditorium has room for 2,160 participants, has some of the best technologies available in the world and is the most modern and functional space for events in the country. According to the Brazilian Association of Convention and Fair Centers (ABRACCEF), there are 17,500 events happening on average throughout the 53 main convention and exhibition centres of Brazil. These activities bring together approximately 28 million participants. Belém has great potential for this type of tourism.

       Traditionally called Val-de-Cães Airport, it is responsible for increasing tourism in the Amazon region, as well as for the outflow of products and attracting new investments. The passenger terminal is fully air conditioned on two levels and has "futuristic" architecture, designed to take advantage of natural lighting. People with special needs have individualized service with own equipment at specific locations to facilitate their access. The terminal's interior is decorated with plants native to the Amazon region and is enclosed by a source able to imitate the sound of the rains that fall every day in the region.
