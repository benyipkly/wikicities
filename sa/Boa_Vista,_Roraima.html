       The city was created on July 9, 1890 as Boa Vista do Rio Branco. It was founded by Augusto Villeroy (Amazonas's Governor). The first mayor was João Capistrano da Silva Mota, also known as Coronel Mota. After the mayor, two councillors (José Francisco Coelho and José Gonzaga de Souza Junior) were appointed.

       In 1943, during the middle of World War II, Boa Vista became the capital of the recently created Federal Territory of

During these fifteen days, there are bonfires, fireworks, and folk dancing in the streets (step names are in French, which shows the mutual influences between court life and peasant culture in the 17th, 18th, and 19th-century Europe).

       Initially, indigenous people were the only inhabitants of Boa Vista. Boa Vista had the highest growth rate of any Brazilian capital in the 1970s, at 3% per year. What attracts immigrants most to this city are employment opportunities that generated by public service jobs for Brazilians. General commercial opportunities attract immigrants from neighboring countries. In 1950 Boa Vista had about 5,200 inhabitants. This number has grown 47 fold in only 56 years to approximately 250,000 inhabitants.
